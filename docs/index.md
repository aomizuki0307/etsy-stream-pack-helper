# Etsy Stream Pack Helper

A seller-only automation tool for my Etsy shop to prepare digital stream overlay packs.

## Purpose
- Generate Etsy-ready assets: listing images (8 JPGs) and 4–5 download ZIP files.
- Optionally create or update **draft** listings so I can review and publish manually.
- No buyer-facing features; seller workflow only.

## Data Access & Limits
- Scope: listings, inventory, media upload (my shop only).
- No buyer data, no orders, no messages.
- Low frequency: a few drafts per day; manual review before publish.

## Compliance
- Uses only official Etsy Open API v3.
- No scraping or automated messaging.
- Caches metadata minimally; no PII stored.
